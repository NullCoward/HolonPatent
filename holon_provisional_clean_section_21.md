## 21. Use Cases Across Domains

The holonic architecture is domain-agnostic and can be applied across a wide spectrum of computational, organizational, creative, and real-world systems. Because each holon is a structured cognitive container with clear Purpose, State, and Action surfaces, the architecture adapts naturally to any environment where reasoning, coordination, stateful computation, or autonomous workflows are required.

This section outlines representative use cases. These broaden the patent scope by demonstrating applicability across industries and technical disciplines.

### 21.12 Human-in-the-Loop and Hybrid Intelligence Systems

Humans can act as holons or supervise holons. Use cases include:
- complex decision review,
- legal or policy evaluation,
- architecture oversight,
- creative direction.

Humans can be selectively inserted where needed.

---

### 21.13 Autonomous Codebases and Self-Maintaining Software

Entire software systems become:
- self-repairing,
- self-optimizing,
- self-monitoring,
- self-evolving.

Holons wrap, instrument, and eventually replace legacy logic incrementally.

---

### 21.14 Secure Multi-Tenant AI Platforms

Holons create natural tenant boundaries. Use cases:
- cloud AI hosting services,
- SaaS platforms with multiple agent groups,
- enterprise multi-division deployments.

Token budgets and Purpose policies enforce strong isolation.
